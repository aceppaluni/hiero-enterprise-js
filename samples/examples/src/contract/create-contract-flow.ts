/**
 * Create Contract Flow — deploy a Hiero smart contract whose bytecode
 * is too large to embed inline (~6KB / HIP-435), in a single call.
 *
 * `ContractCreateFlow` orchestrates the full deploy sequence:
 *
 *  1. `FileCreate` — uploads the first 2KB of bytecode.
 *  2. `FileAppend` — chunks any remaining bytecode (capped by `maxChunks`).
 *  3. `ContractCreate` — deploys the contract against the uploaded file.
 *  4. `FileDelete` — cleans up the bytecode file.
 *
 * For smaller contracts (≤ ~6KB) prefer `createContract` with the
 * `bytecode` field — one transaction, lower fees. For pre-uploaded
 * bytecode prefer `createContract` with `bytecodeFileId`. Use the flow
 * when you have raw bytecode in hand and don't want to manage the file
 * upload yourself.
 *
 * Flows do not accept `TransactionOptions` (max fee, memo, validity
 * duration, node pinning) because each inner transaction is built
 * internally. Only `additionalSigners` / `externalSigners` carry over.
 * Flows also cannot be scheduled — use the regular `createContract` /
 * `scheduleCreateContract` path if you need scheduling.
 *
 * Run: pnpm tsx src/contract/create-contract-flow.ts
