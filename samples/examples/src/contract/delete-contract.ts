/**
 * Delete Contract — permanently remove an already-deployed Hiero smart
 * contract and transfer its remaining HBAR balance to a designated
 * account or contract.
 *
 * Demonstrates the everyday delete scenarios exposed by ContractService:
 *
 * - `deleteContract` with `transferAccountId` — sends remaining HBAR to
 *   an account (the most common path)
 * - `deleteContract` with `transferContractId` — sends remaining HBAR
 *   to another contract instead
 * - `scheduleDeleteContract` — defer the delete behind a scheduled
 *   transaction so additional parties can sign before it executes
 *
 * Deleting a contract requires the contract's `adminKey` to sign the
 * transaction — pass it via `additionalSigners`. Contracts deployed
 * without an admin key are immutable and cannot be deleted (the network
 * returns `MODIFYING_IMMUTABLE_CONTRACT`).
 *
 * Exactly one of `transferAccountId` or `transferContractId` is
 * required — the network needs a destination for the contract's
 * remaining HBAR balance.
 *
 * `deleteContract` returns nothing — per-delete status / timing is
 * delivered through the `before` / `after` listener events on the
 * surrounding `HieroContext`.
 *
 * Run: pnpm tsx src/contract/delete-contract.ts
